      Agreement</strong></h5>
    <p class="paragraph-light">General. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Bookshop.org in the most
      expedient and cost effective manner, you and Bookshop.org agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way
      related to these Terms of Use or the Mobile Terms, including your receipt of text messages from Bookshop.org or
      its service providers, will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in
      court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than
      in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief
      that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way
      related to these Terms of Use, or the Mobile Terms, including your receipt of text messages from Bookshop.org or
      its service providers, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
      theory, and regardless of when a claim arises. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE,
      YOU AND BOOKSHOP.ORG ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT
      THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.<br><br>Exceptions.
      Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, nothing in these Terms of Use will be deemed to waive, preclude, or
      otherwise limit the right of you or Bookshop.org to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii)
      pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available;
      (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) file suit in a
      court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.<br><br>Arbitrator. Any arbitration between
      you and Bookshop.org will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution
      Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American
      Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA
      Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting
      Bookshop.org. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
      applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.<br><br>Notice; Process. If you or
      Bookshop.org intends to seek arbitration, then the party seeking arbitration must first send a written notice of
      the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail (“Notice”). Bookshop.org address for Notice is: 463 Lincoln Place,
      #200, Brooklyn, New York 11238, Attn: General Counsel. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the
      claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). You and Bookshop.org will make good
      faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Bookshop.org do not reach an agreement to do so within
      30 days after the Notice is received, you or Bookshop.org may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
      arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Bookshop.org must not be disclosed to the
      arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. <br><br>Fees. If you commence
      arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Use, Bookshop.org will reimburse you for your payment of the filing
      fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will
      be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
      conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based
      telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that
      either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper
      purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all
      fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Bookshop.org for all monies
      previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner
      in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain
      the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. You and Bookshop.org
      agree that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except
      to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings
      and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and
      upon request from you or Bookshop.org made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.<br><br>No
      Class Actions. YOU AND BOOKSHOP.ORG AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL
      CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further,
      unless both you and Bookshop.org agree otherwise in a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
      one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.<br><br>Modifications
      to this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Use, if Bookshop.org
      makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Bookshop.org address for Notice, you
      may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Bookshop.org address for
      Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will
      continue to govern any disputes between you and Bookshop.org.<br><br>Enforceability. If an arbitrator decides that
      applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations of the “No Class Actions” subsection above
      (addressing class, representative and consolidated proceedings) as to a particular claim for relief, then that
      claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. If any other provision of
      these Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable, the applicable provision shall be deemed stricken and the
      remainder of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.</p><h5 class="header"><strong>Governing Law

      Bookshop.org will remove it immediately and reserves the right to ban the Platform Seller and its Marketplace from
      the Website.<br><br>None of the foregoing shall obligate Bookshop.org to actively screen Seller Content.
      Bookshop.org will not be responsible for the action of any Users, including Customers, with respect to any Seller

      Parties”) from and against any liabilities, claims, costs, damages, demands, causes of action, proceedings or
      other actions, reasonable settlements, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable outside attorneys’
      fees and court costs), whether at law or in equity, brought or asserted by a third party against any Indemnified
      Party (each, a “Claim”) arising out of, related to, or based upon any allegation that the Indemnifying Party’s
      intellectual property (that is, for Bookshop.org, the Website and the Marketplace and, for each Platform Seller,
      the Seller Content, including as incorporated into that Platform Seller’s Marketplace) infringes or constitutes
      misappropriation of any patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other right of a third party. The
      Indemnified Party shall (i) promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of any such Claim (a delay in such
      notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such delay
      prejudices the defense of such Claim) and give the Indemnifying Party the opportunity to defend or settle any such
      Claim at the Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and expense and (ii) cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the
      Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and expense, in defending or settling such Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
      promptly undertake to discharge its obligations hereunder and shall employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the
      Indemnified Party to defend any such Claim asserted against the Indemnified Party; provided, the Indemnifying
      Party may not settle any Claim in a manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Party without such Indemnified
      Party’s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnified Party shall
      have the right to participate in the defense of any Claim at its sole cost and expense.<br><br>In addition to the
      foregoing, if any of the Indemnifying Party’s intellectual property become the subject of a Claim of infringement
      or misappropriation, then the Indemnifying Party shall, at its expense and each Indemnified Party’s option: (a)
      procure the rights in the infringing item or service; (b) replace or modify such service, product or item so that
      it becomes non-infringing or no longer misappropriates in such a manner that does not degrade functionality or
      disrupt the Indemnified Party’s business; or (c) adequately compensate Indemnified Party for the infringing
      services, product or item whose value is diminished as a result of such infringement.<br><br>A Platform Seller may
      remove its Seller Content at any time. If a Platform Seller removes any posting, Bookshop.org will make commercial
      best efforts to promptly cease using that particular posting in promotional materials and derivative Seller
      Content; provided that Bookshop.org may maintain a copy of removed Seller Content for archival and legal purposes.<br><br>Each
      Platform Seller acknowledges and agrees (i) Bookshop.org may establish general practices and limits concerning use
      of the Website or Seller Content, (ii) Bookshop.org reserves the right to change those general practices and
      limits at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice, and (iii) Bookshop.org has no responsibility

      <strong>Confidentiality</strong></h5>
    <p class="paragraph-light">For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any non-public or
      proprietary information or material of either Bookshop.org or a Platform Seller or their respective present and
      future parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies or any of their respective present and future officers,
      directors, stockholders, members, managers, partners, employees, contractors, affiliates, content partners,
      vendors, third-party licensors, distributors, advertisers, other contracting parties, agents, representatives,
      successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, “Representatives,” and together with such party, the “Disclosing
      Party”) disclosed to, received by, or obtained from any source or Person and in any form by the other Party or its
      Representatives (together, the “Receiving Party”) or pursuant to or as a result of Platform Seller’s participation
      in the Platform Seller Program, which should by its nature reasonably be known to be confidential, whether or not
      marked as confidential. Without limiting the foregoing, a Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information includes,
      whether or not designated, all trade secrets, technical and non-technical data, processes, business practices,
      intellectual property, plans or proposals, financial information, information relating to actual or potential
      customers or suppliers or employees or other personnel, personally identifiable information (however such term or
      similar term is defined under applicable law), sales and marketing information, training and operations materials,
      and pricing and other financial information relating to the business or affairs of the Disclosing Party or its
      affiliates. Confidential Information does not include information that (i) is or becomes public knowledge through
      no act, omission or breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; &nbsp;(ii) is received by the Receiving Party
      from a third party not known by the Receiving Party to be under a duty of confidence to the Disclosing Party; or
      (iii) is already rightfully known without confidentiality restriction or is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will not, without the prior written
      consent of the Disclosing Party, disclose or use the Confidential Information for its own purposes except as
      expressly permitted by, or required to achieve the purposes of, these Seller Terms. Each Receiving Party will take
      all reasonable precautions to protect Confidential Information directly disclosed to it by the Disclosing Party,
      using at least the same standard of care as it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own Confidential
      Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the
      extent required (y) to its Representatives with a need to know in connection with these Seller Terms or Platform
      Seller’s participation in the Platform Seller Program and who are bound by non-disclosure terms substantially
      similar hereto or (z) by operation of law or order of a court or governmental agency, or if necessary in any
      proceeding to establish rights or obligations hereunder, with reasonable prior written notice to the Disclosing
      Party (unless legally prohibited) sufficient to permit the Disclosing Party an opportunity to contest or limit the
      nature of such disclosure at its sole cost and expense. Upon request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party
      shall return or destroy (and, upon request, certify to the destruction of) all Disclosing Party’s Confidential
      Information in the possession or under the control of the Receiving Party, except to the extent subject to a
      continuing license, and all copies of such Confidential Information.<br><br>Bookshop.org and each Platform Seller
      acknowledge that monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of the confidentiality
      provisions contained herein and, consequently, if a Receiving Party breaches or threatens to breach such
      provisions, the applicable Disclosing Party will have the right to equitable relief, including injunctive relief
      or specific performance or both, from a court of competent jurisdiction without posting bond, in addition to any
      other remedies to which such Disclosing Party may be entitled at law, in equity, or under these Seller Terms or
      the <a href="#TERMS">Terms of Use</a>. Notwithstanding anything in either these Seller Terms or the Terms of Use
      to the contrary, any breach of the confidentiality provisions contained herein shall not be subject to the
      limitation of liability set forth in the <a href="#TERMS">Terms of Use</a>.</p><h5 class="header"><strong>Termination/Suspension</strong>
    </h5>
    <p class="paragraph-light">Notwithstanding anything in either these Seller Terms or the <a href="#TERMS">Terms of
      Use</a> to the contrary and in addition to all other remedies available under these Seller Terms, either
      Bookshop.org or a Platform Seller may terminate or suspend such Platform Seller’s participation in the Platform
      Seller Program at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without cause. Upon termination or suspension,

      Between Platform Sellers and Bookshop.org</strong></h5>
    <p class="paragraph-light">Neither these Seller Terms nor any Bookstore Member’s participation as a Platform Seller
